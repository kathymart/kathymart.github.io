    <p> So let me tell you a little bit about myself. I'm from a small town in California and I'm going to be an incoming high school Senior this fall (2016). As of this moment, I don't know what I want to major in, but I do like learning about the human body. So I might major in somethig that has to do with that. One of my goals in life is to travel around the world as much as possible because I want to taste different cusines and see different cultures. Something I really like doing is going to the beach because the weather and the view are amazing. I would say that the beach is my happy place. Well thanks for visiting my site and I hope you like it. </p>
